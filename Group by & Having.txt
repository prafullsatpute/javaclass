                             Group by & Having
                           ====================


HAVING Clause:- After group by clause we are not allowed to use where
=============   clause. In place of this one ANSI/ISO SQL provided
                another clause having.
               
Generally if we want to restrict the rows in a table then we are using 
where clause whereas if we want to restrict groups after group by
then we must use having clause.

Generally we are not allowed to use group functions in where clause 
whereas we can also use group functions in having clause.
