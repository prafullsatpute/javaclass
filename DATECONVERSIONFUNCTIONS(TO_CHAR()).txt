3.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month DECEMBER
  from emp table by using to_char() month format?


NOTE:-Whenever we are using to_char() DAY format also oracle
      server internally allocates maximum 9 bytes for DAY field.
whenever passed DAY having less number of bytes then oracle server
does not return any rows.To overcome this problem then we must use
fm(fill mode).
